            <p>Civilization is not inherited; it has to be learned and earned by each generation anew; if the transmission should be interrupted for one century, civilization would die, and we should be savages again.</p>

          <p>It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest. We address ourselves not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities, but of their advantages.</p>

        <p>A thought crossed his mind: How do you make poor people feel wealthy when wages are stagnant? You give them cheap loans.</p>
